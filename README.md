# COMP-313-Computer-Graphics
Comp 313: Computer Graphics. Coded in Python with Numpy and Matplotlib to plot 2D and 3D objects. Used Blender and Python to create an airplane procedural animation.

# Project 1
Group project where we were tasked with using Numpy and Matplotlib to draw a train exactly like an example given. I was tasked with creating the body of the train. Had to communicate with other team members so that the pieces fit together correctly.

# Project 2
Created a model plane in Blender. Had to make sure that all objects were connected and some could be indpendent so that the propeller could spin. Then had to convert to .obj file so that I could plot all the points together in Python with Matplotlib. Also changed the rotation of the plane by altering the coordiates before ploting.

# Project 3
Used the plane from project 2 for procedural animation. Used key frames to make a flightpath and spin the propeller to make it look like a flight simulation. Set up multiple cameras and edited them to make a video presentation.

Smokey Animation_ Lingering Smoke Trail and Clouds in Blender 3.3.1.docx is a paper detailing all the work I did on the final project.

FinalRenderedPlaneFlightVideo.mkv is a video using all 4 cameras placed and rendered from.
